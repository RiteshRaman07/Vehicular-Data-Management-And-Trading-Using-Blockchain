Small demo into the System>
>use metamask to select different account for transaction purpose.
>before adding a mechanic or user to the system,it is mandatory to add their ethereum address into the system by the owner first(from owner ethereum account )
>a mechanic can not register as a user and vice versa.
>most of the basic operation like viewing car data can only done by those accounts which are addded into the system by owner.
>mechanic can not register a car.
>only authorized user can view maintainance report(previous ones also) and authorized mechanic can update/see the report.car owner can
 also revoke the above mentioned  permission if they want.
>no need of admin to transfer car ownership
>can see car previous owner's account
